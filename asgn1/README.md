##plot.sh
File which contains my main code. The code creates the three functions that create the Length, Max Value and Histogram collatz graph. This is done by iterating through each of them and producing a .dat file for the respective graphs which show where the different points are plotted. It is used by running the ./plot.sh which then creates the desired graphs.

##collatz.c
This is the file provided to us that contains the collatz function. Using this was essential to completing the assignment since it provided all the critical elements needed. The program is used by utilizing it within plot.sh to create the graphs.

##Makefile
Is a program that runs on clang that helps compile your files so they are able to run and execute the collatz program. The program is used by typing make into the terminal or make file name to compile a certain file.

##README.md
A mark down that lists the different programs and their functions in one place. Contains all the contents of the deliverables.
